# About me

I am a math major in NTHU (National Tsing Hua University) in Taiwan. I like math, computer science and software engineering.

# I use arch btw

Here is my dotfiles repository [xDDoubleTea/dotfiles](https://github.com/xDDoubleTea/dotfiles), I am using Lazyvim and tmux on hyprland.  
I'm still learning how to do stuff the correct way.

# Stuff

I'm developing a discord bot using discord.py and a minecraft java plugin using spigot. I'm bad at programming.  
I have a cool tetris game written in C using the allegro library, which was my final project for the Introduction to Programming I in the CS department, I might make it public after I cleaned that up.
